        <p>The Fellowship of the Ring is the first of three volumes in The Lord of the Rings, an epic set in the fictional world of
        Middle-earth. The Lord of the Rings is an entity named Sauron, the Dark Lord, who long ago lost the One Ring that
        contains much of his power. His overriding desire is to reclaim the Ring and use it to enslave all of Middle-earth.</br>
        
        The story of The Lord of the Rings begins with several events that take place in The Hobbit. While wandering lost in a
        deep cave, Bilbo Baggins, a Hobbit—one of a small, kindly race about half the size of Men—stumbles upon a ring and takes
        it back with him to the Shire, the part of Middle-earth that is the Hobbits’ home. All Bilbo knows of his ring is that
        wearing it causes him to become invisible. He is unaware that it is the One Ring, and is therefore oblivious to its
        significance and to the fact that Sauron has been searching for it.</br>
        
        The Fellowship of the Ring opens with a party for Bilbo’s 111th birthday. Bilbo gives his ring to his heir, his cousin
        Frodo Baggins. When the time comes to part with the ring, however, Bilbo becomes strangely reluctant to do so. He gives
        up the ring only at the determined urging of his friend, Gandalf the Grey, a great Wizard. Gandalf suspects that the
        ring is indeed the One Ring of legend. After confirming his suspicions, he tells Frodo that the Ring must be taken away
        from the Shire, as Sauron’s power is growing once again.</br>
        
        Frodo sets out from the Shire with three of his Hobbit friends—Sam, Merry, and Pippin. Along the way, they are pursued
        by the nine Ringwraiths, servants of Sauron who take the form of terrifying Black Riders. The hobbits spend a night in
        the company of wandering Elves, who promise to send word ahead to friends who will protect the hobbits. Barely out of
        the Shire, the hobbits get lost in the Old Forest, where they have to be rescued from a malevolent willow tree, which
        swallows up Merry and Pippin, and then from an evil tomb ghost. The hobbits’ rescuer is Tom Bombadil, a strange, jovial
        entity with great powers who is the oldest creature in Middle-earth.</br>
        
        The hobbits make it to the town of Bree, where they meet Aragorn, a Ranger who roams the wilderness and who is the heir
        of the Kings of the ancient Men of Westernesse. Those who do not know Aragorn’s true name call him Strider. Frodo tries
        to keep a low profile at the inn in Bree, but he ends up causing a scene when while taking part in a rollicking
        rendition of a song he falls, accidentally slips the Ring onto his finger, and vanishes.</br>
        
        That night, Aragorn advises the hobbits not to sleep in their rooms at the inn. In doing so, he saves their lives—for
        the first of many times. A letter Gandalf left at the inn months before advises the group to head for Rivendell, a realm
        of the Elves. Aragorn sets out with the hobbits the next day, and with his help they avoid the Black Riders for some
        time. However, at the top of the hill Weathertop, the Company is forced to defend itself against the attacking Riders.
        Frodo is wounded during the skirmish.</br>
        
        Frodo’s wound, made by a weapon of a servant of Sauron, plagues the hobbit as the Company makes its way eastward.
        Aragorn is greatly concerned about the power the wound might exert over Frodo. Near Rivendell they meet the Elf-lord
        Glorfindel, who has been out looking for them. At the last ford before Rivendell, Frodo, riding Glorfindel’s horse,
        outruns the ambushing Black Riders, who are swept away in a flood created by Elrond, the master of Rivendell.</br>
        
        Elrond heals Frodo and then holds a meeting to discuss what to do about the Ring. During this Council, Frodo learns the
        full history of the Ring. Frodo accepts the burden of taking the Ring to the only place it can be destroyed—the place
        where it was forged. It promises to be a long, nearly impossible journey, as the Ring was forged in the Cracks of Doom,
        part of the fiery mountain Orodruin in the very heart of Sauron’s realm of Mordor.</br>
        
        At the end of the meeting, the Council creates a group to help Frodo in his quest. In addition to Frodo, the Fellowship
        of the Ring includes Sam, Merry, Pippin, Aragorn, Gandalf, an Elf named Legolas, a Dwarf named Gimli, and a Man from the
        south named Boromir.</br>
        
        The Fellowship heads south and attempts to pass over the Misty Mountains via the pass of Caradhras. Their way is blocked
        by snow and rock slides, and they are forced to divert their path through the Mines of Moria—the ancient, underground
        realm of the Dwarves. During the journey through Moria, Gandalf falls into the chasm of Khazad-dûm while protecting the
        Company from a Balrog, a terrible demon.</br>
        
        The rest of the party continues on to Lórien, the forest of the Galadrim Elves, where the Lady Galadriel tests their
        hearts and gives them gifts to help them on the quest. Frodo, spellbound by Galadriel’s power and wisdom, offers her the
        Ring. She refuses, however, saying that, despite her intentions, the Ring would corrupt her; ultimately, she would only
        replace Sauron.</br>
        
        Leaving Lórien, the Fellowship travels by boat down the Great River, Anduin. At night, they spot Gollum—a deformed
        creature that had once owned the Ring but then lost it to Bilbo Baggins in The Hobbit—following them. When they reach
        the Falls of Rauros, the Fellowship must decide whether to head toward Mordor on the east or toward the safety of the
        city of Minas Tirith to the west.</br>
        
        Boromir, overcome by the Ring’s power and desiring the Ring for himself, confronts Frodo. Frodo fends off Boromir and
        decides that he must go on to Mordor rather than to the safety of Minas Tirith. However, Frodo cannot bear the thought
        of imperiling his friends on the dangerous journey or allowing the Ring to corrupt them, so he attempts to leave
        secretly and continue the quest alone. Frodo does not, however, manage to elude Sam, so the two of them set out together
        for Mordor. <hr>

        <p><em> The Two Towers</em> opens with the disintegration of the Fellowship, as Merry and Pippin are taken captive by Orcs after the death of Boromir in battle. The Orcs, having heard a prophecy that a Hobbit will bear a Ring that gives universal power to its owner, wrongly think that Merry and Pippin are the Ring-bearers.

Several other members of the Fellowship, including Gimli, Legolas, and Aragorn, resolve to pursue Merry and Pippin. They follow the hobbits’ tracks through fields and forests, always on the lookout for Orcs. The group encounters the Riders of Rohan, led by Éomer. <br>

Meanwhile, Merry and Pippin are being conveyed back to Orc headquarters when Orcs from another tribe, the Uruk-hai, kidnap them in pursuit of the Ring they believe the hobbits to be carrying. Pippin and Merry escape the Orcs and travel through the forest near the Entwash River, where an Ent (a giant treelike creature) named Fangorn befriends them. Fangorn offers the hobbits nourishment and conveys them to an Ent assembly. There, the Ents resolve to go to war against the Orcs of Isengard (creatures controlled by the corrupted wizard Saruman), who have been cruel to them.

Meanwhile, Saruman haunts Aragorn and his group as they travel the forest. Gandalf then appears to them, reborn after his earlier death in The Fellowship of the Ring as Gandalf the White, also known as the White Rider. Gandalf guides Aragorn’s group to Edoras, the Golden Hall of King Théoden. There, Gandalf exposes Théoden’s counselor, Wormtongue, as a spy for the evil Saruman. Gandalf also facilitates a reunion between Théoden and Éomer.<br>

The group then proceeds to confront Saruman at Isengard, where they are surprised to find Merry and Pippin at the gates of Saruman’s headquarters. The hobbits tell Gandalf that the Ents wish to meet with him, to offer their aid in the struggle against Saruman. The group finds Wormtongue in Saruman’s tower, Orthanc. Wormtongue tries to kill Gandalf by throwing an object down on him from a window. That object is a palantír, a magic seeing-stone that transmits images. Pippin looks into the palantír, which allows the Dark Lord Sauron to discover where Pippin is and pursue him.

The second half of The Two Towers rejoins Frodo and Sam just after they separate from the rest of the Fellowship and begin making their way to Mordor to destroy the Ring. As they travel, they meet the creature Gollum, whom they tame and force to be their guide to Mordor. Sam and Frodo are wary of Gollum—they know he owned the Ring before and wishes to regain it—but they desperately need someone to direct them to their destination.<br>

Frodo, Sam, and Gollum journey through a smelly marshland in which they can see the faces of slain warriors haunting the waters. They travel by night, as Gollum cannot stand the sun, so they are cold and hungry most of the time. They finally reach the Black Gate of the realm of Mordor and see Sauron’s Dark Tower rising overhead. The Gate is well guarded, and the hobbits wonder how they will be able to get inside. Gollum directs them to a different, hidden path into Mordor, where the guards will likely be sparser. On the way, the hobbits are frightened by dark shapes flying overhead—the Nazgûl, the Black Riders of Sauron who are searching for the Ring.

Along the way, Frodo meets a band of Men led by Faramir, the younger brother of Boromir. The men are suspicious of the hobbits at first, believing they are responsible for Boromir’s death. Frodo avoids telling Faramir that his brother betrayed the Fellowship by attempting to seize the Ring for himself, but Sam blurts it out. Faramir is shocked, but grateful to learn the truth, so he offers support to the hobbits’ journey. Faramir’s men nearly kill Gollum, who is caught as an intruder, but Frodo intercedes to save the creature.

Gollum leads Frodo and Sam up the mountain called Cirith Ungol and into tunnels inhabited by Shelob, a giant, deadly female spider. Shelob paralyzes Frodo with her sting, but Sam kills the spider. Frodo and Sam are separated, however, as Orc guards find Frodo and proceed to take him off to their headquarters, where they plan to search him for the Ring. Sam believes Frodo to be dead, so he accepts the responsibility of carrying the Ring by himself.<br>

Surrounded by Orcs, the terrified Sam dons the Ring and finds that it enables him to understand the Orc language. Sam follows the guards who carry off the paralyzed Frodo. Upon hearing them mention that Shelob only devours living creatures, Sam is shocked to realize that his friend is alive. He chastises himself for taking the Ring for himself, unaware that he has actually saved the Ring and kept it from Sauron by taking it from Frodo. Sam realizes that Frodo is alive at the very moment when the guards enter Mordor, slamming the gates in Sam’s face. As The Two Towers ends, Sam is anguished by the thought that he and Frodo are separated.
