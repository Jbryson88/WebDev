                <li><strong>The Omega Speedmaster</strong>
                     is a line of chronograph wristwatches produced by Omega SA. While chronographs
                    have been around since the late 1800s, Omega first introduced this line of chronographs in 1957.
                </li>
                <li>Since then, many different chronograph movements have been marketed under the Speedmaster name.
                </li>
                <li>The manual winding Speedmaster Professional or "Moonwatch" is the best-known and longest-produced;
                    it was worn during the first American spacewalk as part of NASA's Gemini 4 mission and was the first
                    watch worn by an astronaut walking on the Moon during the Apollo 11 mission.</li>
                <li>The Speedmaster Professional remains one of several watches qualified by NASA for spaceflight and is
                    still the only one so qualified for EVA.</li>
                <li>The Speedmaster line also includes other models, including analog-digital and automatic mechanical
                    watches.</li>
                <li> A variety of other types of watches have used the Speedmaster brand, including many different
                    automatic day and day-date models, the tuning fork movement Speedsonic line, and the digital LCD
                    Speedmaster Quartz (the Speedsonic and LCD Speedmaster where also prototyped in ten examples each
                    under the Alaska project but not taken up by NASA). The digital-analog Speedmaster X-33 was produced
                    in 1998; it was qualified for space missions by NASA and flown on the Mir space station and Space
                    Shuttle Columbia during STS-90 later that year.</li>
